                About the Legend
            </h1>
 
             
 
<p> Born on March 2, 1942 in Ifewara, Osun State, located in the South-Western part of Nigeria, Pastor Adeboye had a strong desire to attend school in spite of his poor background. He was admitted to Ilesha Grammar School, Osun State, Nigeria in 1956. Young Adeboye had an aptitude for science, particularly mathematics, which he chose to pursue at the university level. He was admitted to a leading Nigerian university, The University of Nigeria, Nsukka, to study mathematics. He was there a while but had to move to the University of Ibadan, Nigeria to continue his education, due to the ongoing Nigerian civil war at the time. 
    He obtained his B.Sc. in Mathematics from the university of ibadan between 1964-1967 and subsequently got his PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Lagos, and worked as a lecturer in mathematics at the universities of Lagos and Ilorin; After joining the RCCG in 1973, he began working to translate the sermons of its founder and then Pastor, Rev. Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi, from Yoruba into English. He is neither the Pope nor the leader of the free world, but he heads a denomination that since his assumption of office as its General Overseer, has established churches in over 198 countries and territories of the world.

    He was, as early as 2008, listed by Newsweek, as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Earlier in 1998, the Holy Ghost Congress of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Lekki, Lagos, was reported to be one of the largest Christian gatherings ever and every year the RCCG Convention and Congresses have live crowds breaking that record. Through the years, miracles of every kind have been commonplace in his ministry.
    
    But the moral of the story is not in these achievements but in how his behaviour has remained unaffected by them.<br>
    It was Mummy G.O. who said to us once, “see how God uses your father as a smokescreen to do the miracles He wants to do”.
    
    This realization, that “apart from Him, you can do nothing” and that “ no one can receive anything that is not given to him by God”, probably explains why a man so spiritually and intellectually gifted, so revered, so respected by the high and low alike, would still be so genuinely humble, so self-effacing and so unfailingly respectful even of his subordinates.
    
    His impeccable integrity, his measured speech and action at all times, his life of many challenges, many wars, his courage, his unshaken faith, his deep love for God, through phenomenal achievements and numbing personal tragedy are all together the most persuasive evangelical message to all even those of other faiths, of the grace and mercy of God in the life of the Saved.
    
    For us, we are extremely proud that this man of extraordinary faith, courage and humility is one we can call our daddy.
